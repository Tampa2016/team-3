Ideas

Connecting volunteers to those with needs.

Database
  -Users(name, etc), points, type of user: volunteer etc, grab information from yelp
  -allow someone to upload image to newsfeed, if we click image, we can pull more information about the image. 
  -display a newsfeed to people using the app (based on location (if time permits))
  -accessabilities: attribiutes, what's available. 
  -create instances in databsase which contain the location or profile of a place with a respective score. 

Instagram meets yelp, when people take pictures or videos, their location can be targeted for further use.
  -"Explore around me" option. Find nearby locations (in categories such as emergency, hotel, restaurant, entertainment, etc.)
  -Clicking on a page brings up a list with nearby options in that category ranked by ADA accesibility score and Yelp score.
  -Possible direct message request option for users to communicate/ask more about a given post
  
Web and Mobile app

Incentivize with company sponsorships that give rewards based on points system.
  -Points earned for posting photos/videos/reviews
  -Redeem pionts for giftcards/prizes
