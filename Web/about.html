  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p> <br/> This website and its companion iOS application strive to improve the quality of life for persons living with physical  </p>
  <p>	disabilities. This is accomplished through an application that motivates individuals (both those living with and without </p>
  <p>	paralysis) to report on inaccessible places. Users are awarded points for providing images and reviews of various </p>
  <p> locations and for assessing the credibility of the reviews made by other usersUsers can either redeem points for gift cards </p> 
  <p> provided by corporate sponsors of Yada or choose to have money donated to charity in their name. Companies could use this </p>
  <p> app to run corporate social responsibility programs with their employees. </p>
  <p> <br/> By bringing a stronger awareness of these barriers to the general public, we are one step closer to eliminating such obstacles. </p>
  
  <h1> What it Does </h1>
  <p> <br/> This app allows users to upload photos and written reviews about the accessibility of particular businesses and locations. </p>
  <p> Users can also use the "Explore" function to find nearby locations in a particular category ranked based on a combination of </p>
  <p> their proximity, Yelp scores, and the ADA accesibility scores that are calculated from the user reviews. </p>
